# Image Classifier Project

This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The model, trained on 60,000 images across 100 classes, achieved over 95% accuracy. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation and flipping were implemented to enhance model robustness, while hyperparameter tuning optimized performance. The project also placed 13th out of 120 participants in a Kaggle challenge within a graduate-level computer vision course, showcasing the effectiveness of the model in a competitive setting.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Folder in Google Drive:**
   - Create a folder named `SFU_CMPT_CV_lab2` in your Google Drive.

2. **Download the Required Files:**
   - Download the files `cifar100.tar.gz`, `train.tar.gz`, and `test.tar.gz` from [this Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18n3s1BnaJgtLxYHPWnBF2WL0MoI-7JBr).
   - Move these files into the `SFU_CMPT_CV_lab2` folder you just created.

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open the `lab2.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
   - Ensure that the Colab environment is connected to your Google Drive to access the files.
   - Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the code.

By following these steps, you will set up the environment required for the project and be able to run the image classification model on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
