# Image Classifier Project

This project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. The model, trained on 60,000 images across 100 classes, achieved over 95% accuracy. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation and flipping were implemented to enhance model robustness, while hyperparameter tuning optimized performance. The project also placed 13th out of 120 participants in a Kaggle challenge within a graduate-level computer vision course, showcasing the effectiveness of the model in a competitive setting.
